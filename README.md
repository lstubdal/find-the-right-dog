# Find the right dog (dobreed selector)
(Course project for web design 2)

A webiste to help users find a suitable dogbreed, as well information about what to thnk about when getting a dog.
The user can answer 10 questions and based on the answer, dogbreeds will be filtered after their expectaions and wishes.
User can also scroll through all the dogbreeds, and click on each breed to get more information about a specific breed.

Future development (if I had more time)
 - error handeling for when no dogs left after filter users input
 - error handeling is user selects more than 1 option
 - let user search after specific breed at 'all breeds' page
 - let user filter in a sidebar at 'all breeds' page
 - show results of other dogbreeds that was close to users selections
 - show only 20 dogs at the time per page
